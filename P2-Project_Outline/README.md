## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Think about back to when you were taking a road trip with your family.  I remember having a map or atlas out on my lap, praying I didnâ€™t fall asleep and that I was paying attention enough for my mom not to miss her turn.  The only attractions we knew were coming up were either those we looked up beforehand or those random detours when we saw signs on the highway.  This project brings the excitement of the road trip without worrying about the planning.  This is where RoadTrip Runner comes in!  It is designed for the every-day user, young or old, to plan their ideal road trip.  They will be able to filter their trip by budget and by attraction (nature, city, touristy, etc).  Users will find this useful because it will have a simple, easy to use interface that will show their desired destinations along their route.  This will provide our users with a carefully curated road trip that will be one to remember!

### Features
User Profile: Users will be able to create an account with a secure login.

Start and End:  Users will be able to enter a start and an end location and our app will supply a list of possibilities in between. 

Save: User will be able to select from that listening and that will allow them to customize their trip.  User will be able to save their trip.

### Technologies
-Thymeleaf (want to transition to Angular)
-SpringBoot
-SQL
-Java

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to dive heavily into APIs and learn how they work since much of this app will rely on the use of APIs.  I will also need to cement my Thymeleaf and Angular knowledge.
